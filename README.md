# Android application

## Overview

The application retrieves data quality reports collected by the CZTI component of the [ASTROSAT satllite](https://web.iucaa.in/~astrosat/czti_specs.html) and displays them on an android device. 
Astrosat is India's first dedicated multi-wavelength space telescope. More info about this can be found [here](http://astrosat.iucaa.in/). [Application Screenshots](https://github.com/ankitdani/iucaa_x/tree/master/Screenshots/Frontend)

## Testing

Alpha testing was successfully conducted on 10+ users and the application was compatible for 80% of the devices that ran on the android version Marshmallow. More details about the testing can be found [here](https://github.com/ankitdani1997/iucaa_x/tree/master/Screenshots/Testing%20Results).

## UI

### Springer

[Comparative Analysis for an Optimized Data-Driven System](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-15-0790-8_4)

The paper compares a django architecture design and a naive approach to retieve data from a server on factors like retrieval time and efficiency proving that the data retrieval speed can be improved by 97.2% by using a django architecture and google volley.
